### Description
This script is a prank which creates a task which open up a rick roll every time the user logs on to the target machine. 

First, the script opens up a PowerShell window with admin privileges, and accepts the popup which confirms that PowerShell is able to make changes.

Once the PowerShell window is open, it writes out 4 lines of code which creates the task to open up the specified YouTube link whenever the user logs onto the machine. To make it easier to detect and remove, the task is not hidden or disguised as a normal windows start-up task.
